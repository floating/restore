# Restore

*A __predictable__, __observable__, __immutable__ state container for React apps*

- __Predictable__ - Unidirectional data flow makes easy to test, debug and reason about your application.
- __Observable__ - Observable state automatically keeps your components in sync without unnecessary renders.
- __Immutable__ - Frozen state and targeted thaw/replace updates provide baked in immutability.
- __DevTools__ - Helpful DevTools, including time travel, are easily dropped into your application providing clear visibility of your state, actions, updates and observers.

## Install

```
npm install react-restore
```

## Creating a `store`

A `store` holds the `state` of the application and the `actions` used to update that `state`.

```javascript
import Restore from 'react-restore'
import * as actions from './actions'
let initialState = {text: 'Hello World'}
let store = Restore.create(initialState, actions)
```

Now we have a store.

## Accessing values in the `store`

To get the `text` value from the `store` we would do...

```javascript
store('text') // 'Hello World'
```

## Updating values in the `store`

To update values in the `store` we use `actions`. `actions` are passed in as an object during `store` creation. The object can be created explicitly or by using import syntax. e.g. `import * as actions from './actions'`

We'll create an `action` called `setText` to update the `text` value in our `store`.

```javascript
export const setText = (update, newText) => {
  update(state => {
    state.text = newText
    return state
  })
}
```

`setText` can now be called via the `store`...

```javascript
store.setText('Updated World')
```

This would update the value `text` in the store to `'Updated World'`. `actions` are passed the `update` method as their first argument, followed by any arguments you passed to them.

## The `update` method

The `update` method is how we change values held by the `store`. The `update` method is passed an updater function. If you look back at our `setText` `action` example you can see our updater function looks something like...

```javascript
state => {
  state.text = newText
  return state
}
```

The `updater` function is passed the `state` (or part of the `state`) and returns an updated version of it.

## Targeting state updates with `update`

`update` takes a dot notation path as an optional first argument. This allows you to target part of the `state` instead of the whole `state`. By doing this, only the components that care about what you're targeting will re-render and the rest will not.

For example, our `setText` action could be written as...

```javascript
export const setText = (update, newText) => {
 update('text', text => {
   return newText
 })
}
```

or...

```javascript
export const setText = (update, newText) => update('text', text => newText)
```

Targeting updates with a more complex `state`...

```javascript
import Restore from 'react-restore'
import * as actions from './actions'
let initialState = {
  nested: {
    wordOne: 'Hello',
    wordTwo: 'World'
  }
}
let store = Restore.create(initialState, actions)
```

An `action` to update the nested value `wordTwo`...

```javascript
export const setNestedText = (update, newWordTwo) => {
  update('nested.wordTwo', wordTwo => newWordTwo)
}
```

and calling it is the same as before...

```javascript
store.setNestedText('Updated!')
```

## Connecting the `store` to your `React` components

Connecting React components to the `store` is as easy as...

```javascript
Restore.connect(Component)
```

Once a component is connected, it will have access to the `store` via `this.store` and will automatically re-render itself when a value it uses from the `store` changes.

A connected component inherits the `store` of its closest connected parent. At the top level of your app you will explicitly connect a `store` to the component since it has no parent to inherit from. This is the `store` that will be passed down to your other connected components. We recommend using a single top-level `store` for your app.

```javascript
Restore.connect(Component, store) // Explicitly connects store to Component
Restore.connect(Component) // Component inherits store from parent Component
```

To access values or call `actions` of the `store` from within a connected component, we do the same as before but this time referencing `this.store`.

```javascript
this.store('text')
```

```javascript
this.store.setText('Updated World')
```

## Putting it together

`App.jsx`
```jsx

import React from 'react'
import Restore from 'react-restore'

class App extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div onClick={() => this.store.setText('Updated World')}>
        {this.store('text')}
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Restore.connect(App)

```

`actions.js`
```javascript

export const setText = (update, newText) => {
  update('text', text => {
    return newText
  })
}

```

`index.js`
```javascript

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Restore from 'react-restore'

import App from './App.jsx'
import * as actions from './actions.js'

let initialState = {text: 'Hello World'}
let store = Restore.create(initialState, actions)
let Root = Restore.connect(App, store)

ReactDOM.render(<Root />, document.getElementById('root'))

```

## Enabling DevTools / Time Travel

Restore ships with a dev tools component (`<Restore.DevTools />`) that you can drop anywhere in your application to enable the dev tools.

## Standalone Observers

Connected components become observers but you can leverage this functionality outside of components too.

```javascript

store.observer(() => {
  console.log(store('text'))
})

```

This function will run once immediately and again anytime the values it consumes change -- in this case our `text` value.
